# Integration guide

### Payment process:
- Show available payment methods

- Once customer selected payment; create CTP payment object and set required fields as described [here](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/blob/master/docs/Field-Mapping.md). **Note**: ensure new payment object is created (**do not reuse existing one**) if:
  - Cart has changed (items, quantity, total amount, shipping/billing address, ...)
  - Customer selected payment method (does not matter if same as before or not)
  - Payment has changed (amount planned, currency, transaction type, ...)

- Assign created payment object to the cart

- Once customer is ready to pay and order make sure:
  - `Cart#cartState` is `Active`. In case it is `Merged` order (order can be fetched by merged cart ID) confirmation page should be shown.

  - Ensure cart totals are up to date (execute cart [recalculate](https://dev.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-carts.html#recalculate))

  - [Validate payment](#validate-payment). In case of successful validation order can be created right away and order confirmation page shown.

- Add transaction of type `Authorization` or `Charge` to existing/newly created CTP payment object and call `handle URL` to trigger transaction processing against Payone payment provider.
- Process `handle URL` response:

  **HTTP status code 200**
  - In case transaction state is `Success` create an order and show order confirmation page.

  - In case transaction state is `Pending` and `redirectUrl` is defined (which is the case of redirect payments like PayPal, Sofort√ºberweisung or Credit Card 3D secure) as custom field within payment object (as also within response body of the handleUrl call) then customer should be redirected to `redirectUrl`.

    - Customer successfully finalizes payment process supplied by `redirectUrl`

      - **Customer is redirected back to shop's successUrl**. After successful payment customer will get redirected to `successUrl`, which has been provided by the front end during payment object creation.  **Before order creation** some necessary validations has to be executed:

        - Check if current cart has been ordered already (`Cart#cartState` = `Merged`). This might happen if multiple tabs are in use. In this case load order by merged cart ID and show oder confirmation page.

        - Ensure cart totals are up to date (execute cart [recalculate](https://dev.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-carts.html#recalculate))

        - Validate if UUID supplied within customer redirect `successUrl` matches UUID persisted within `Payment#customFields#successUrl` or `validationToken` (see [Success URL creation](#success-url-creation))

        - [Validate payment](#validate-payment). If amounts do not match &mdash; show error message to the customer and consider to initiate refund (required only in case of successful transaction of type `Charge`). In this case customer will have to start a new payment process. **Note**: _payone-integration-service_ doesn't support `refund` endpoint yet but it is in the [roadmap](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/issues/167) already.

        - In case all above validations were successful an order can be created and order confirmation page shown.

      - **Customer successfully paid but successUrl was not reached**. In some payment redirect cases there might be a valid payment but no order as user did not reach front end's `successUrl`. For example after successfully issued payment customer loses internet connection or accidentally closes the tab. Usage of scheduled [commercetools-payment-to-order-processor](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payment-to-order-processor) job ensures that for every successful payment an order can still be asynchronously created.

  **Other HTTP status codes**
  - Payment service error details are provided within response body. Payment provider specific error details in payment object (within `Payment#paymentStatus` field).

### Success URL creation
In order to avoid payment manipulation (re-usage of same `successUrl` for different carts) ensure that every `successUrl` includes generated unique UUID as part of the URL or as a parameter. Optionally generated UUID might be additionally persisted on payment object as custom field `validationToken` (custom type might need to be extended)

### Validate payment
Payment counts as successful if there is at least one successful (`Payment#Transaction#state`=`Success`) payment transaction of type `Charge` or `Authorization` where both `Payment#amountPlanned` and `Payment#transaction#amount` matches current cart's total amount. Successful payment might still be invalidated (**edge case**) if there is at least one successful (`#Transaction#state`=`Success`) transaction of **other** type than `Charge` or `Authorization` and `#Transaction#amount` greater than `0`.

### Bad practice
- Never delete or un-assign created payment objects **during checkout** from the cart. If required &mdash; clean up  unused/obsolete payment objects by another asynchronous process instead.
