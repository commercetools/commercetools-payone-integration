        <h1>Charge Credit Card Immediately (verified by 3-D Secure)</h1>
        <p>
            The integration service allows to charge a credit card in a one step process without initiating a separate
            authorization before.
        </p>
        <p>
            It will do so by sending an <em c:set="#requestType">authorization</em> request to the PAYONE platform.
            <br/>
            It will store information about such a request as an interface interaction of type
            <em>PAYONE_INTERACTION_REQUEST</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a verification by 3-D Secure is required, it will store the response from PAYONE
            as an interface interaction of type <em>PAYONE_INTERACTION_REDIRECT</em> with a field "redirectUrl" containing the actual
            redirect url to follow.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if the verification fails?</h3>
        <p>
            That's out of the Integration Service's scope.<br/>
            The Integration Service is notified by PAYONE only in case of a successful verification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The checkout implementation needs to take care of failed verifications - the user will be redirected to
            the <em>errorUrl</em> specified in the Payment object.
