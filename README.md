# commercetools <-> PAYONE Integration Service

This software provides an integration between the [commercetools eCommerce platform](http://dev.sphere.io) API
and the [PAYONE](http://www.payone.de) payment service provider API. 

It is a standalone Microservice that connects the two cloud platforms and provides own helper APIs to checkout
implementations.
