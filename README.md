# commercetools <-> PAYONE Integration Service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration)

This software provides an integration between the [commercetools eCommerce platform](http://dev.commercetools.com) API
and the [PAYONE](http://www.payone.de) payment service provider (server API). 

It is a standalone Microservice that connects the two cloud platforms and provides a small own helper API to force immediate handling of a payment.

## Documentation

This project is using [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) for system tests, which is a kind of "living specification". 
Therefore the [test definitions and results](http://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-payone-integration/latest/spec/specs/Specs.html) are the most precise documentation of the behavior. 
They are automatically generated, updated and published to the `gh_pages` branch of this project by the [TravisCI continuous integration](https://travis-ci.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration) setup. 

## Related Documentation

 * commercetools API documentation at http://dev.commercetools.com
 * commercetools JVM SDK Javadoc at http://sphereio.github.io/sphere-jvm-sdk/javadoc/master/index.html
 * commercetools general payment conventions, esp. for the payment type modeling https://github.com/nkuehn/payment-specs
 * PAYONE API documentation https://pmi.pay1.de/merchants/?navi=downloads

## Docker images

On each push to the remote github repository, a Docker image is build by travis CI.

### Tags

Every image has the following tags:
- short git commit SHA (first 8 chars), e.g. `11be0178`
- tag containing the travis build number, e.g. `travis-17`
- `latest` (if `master` branch) or `branch-name` (if not `master` branch)

https://hub.docker.com/r/sphereio/commercetools-payone-integration/tags/

### Release Tag

To create a release tag for a Docker image, a new git commit tag has to be created manually.

This will trigger a new Docker build by travis CI and will create two additional Docker tags:
- git tag value, e.g. `v1.0.1`
- `production`

The git release tag can be created via command line or github UI ("Draft new Release" https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/releases)

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Minor text adjustments."
```
 
## Using the Integration in a project

> TODO link to generic tutorial on how to do payments once available.

### Required Configuration in the commercetools project

 * This integration assumes that the [conventional custom types](https://github.com/nkuehn/payment-integration-specifications/tree/master/types) for the payment methods are available in the project. 
   If they are not found, this service automatically creates them when started. 
 * In the code that creates payments, have a good plan on how to fill the "reference" custom field. 
   It appears on the customer's account statement or the customer must put it into the transfer. 
   It also must be unique. Often the Order Number is used, but this may not always suffice. 

#### Domain Constraints 

 If the PAYONE invoice generation feature or the Klarna payment methods are to be supported, the checkout has to make  sure that 
 `amountPlanned = Sum over all Line Items ( round ( totalPrice.centAmount / quantity ) * quantity ))` and handle deviations accordingly.  
 Deviations can especially occur if absolute discounts are applied and there are Line Items with quantity > 1.  
 On deviations the Line Item Data will not be transferred to PAYONE. 

### Required Configuration in PAYONE

https://pmi.pay1.de/

 * Create a Payment Portal of type "Shop" for the site you are planning (please also maintain separate portal for 
   automated testing, demo systems etc.)
 * Set the hashing algorithm to "md5 oder sha2-384 (fÃ¼r Migration)" ("advanced" tab in the portal config)
 * Put the notification listener URL of where you will deploy the microservice into "Transaction Status URL" in the 
   "advanced" tab of the portal. The value typically is https://{your-service-instance.example.com}/payone/notification .  
 * Configure the "riskcheck" settings as intended (esp. 3Dsecure)

> Do not use a merchant account across commercetools projects, you may end up mixing customer accounts (debitorenkonten). 

### Configuration of the Integration Service itself

The integration service requires - _unless otherwise stated_ - the following environment variables. 

At the end of this README you can find a copy/paste shell template that sets the variables. Alternatively you can use
[a properties file](#appendix-2-alternative-configuration-via-properties-file).

##### commercetools API client credentials

Name | Content
---- | -------
`CT_PROJECT_KEY` | the project key
`CT_CLIENT_ID` | the client id
`CT_CLIENT_SECRET` | the client secret

Can be found in [Commercetools Merchant Center](https://admin.sphere.io/).

##### PAYONE API client credentials

Name                 | Content             | Required  |
---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
`PAYONE_PORTAL_ID`   | Payment portal ID   | **Yes**   |
`PAYONE_KEY`         | Payment portal key  | **Yes**   |
`PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID` | Merchant account ID | **Yes**   |
`PAYONE_SUBACC_ID`   | Subaccount ID       | **Yes**   |
`PAYONE_MODE`        | Payment mode        | **No**    |

Can be found in the [PAYONE Merchant Interface](https://pmi.pay1.de/).

These credentials should not be necessary in the frontend application if all transaction initiation is done through this service. 

##### Service configuration parameters

All optional.

Name | Content | Default
---- | ------- | --------
`SHORT_TIME_FRAME_SCHEDULED_JOB_CRON` | [QUARTZ cron expression](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger) to specify when the service will poll for commercetools messages generated in the past 10 minutes like [PaymentInteractionAdded](http://dev.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-messages.html#payment-interaction-added-message) | poll every 30 seconds
`LONG_TIME_FRAME_SCHEDULED_JOB_CRON`  | [QUARTZ cron expression](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger) to specify when the service will poll for commercetools messages generated in the past 2 days | poll every hour on 5th second
`PAYONE_MODE`                         | the mode of operation with PAYONE <ul><li>`"live"` for production mode, (i.e. _actual payments_) or</li><li>`"test"` for test mode</li></ul> | `"test"`  
`CT_START_FROM_SCRATCH`               | :warning: _**Handle with care!**_ If and only if equal, ignoring case, to `"true"` the service will create the custom types it needs. _**Therefor it first deletes all Order, Cart, Payment and Type entities**_. If not yet in the project, the Custom Types are created independently of this parameter (but only deleted and recreated if this parameter is set).  Related: [issue #34](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/issues/34). | `"false"`
`SECURE_KEY`                          | if provided and not empty, the value is used as the key for decrypting data from fields "IBAN" and "BIC" for payments with CustomType "PAYMENT_BANK_TRANSFER". The data must be the result of a Blowfish ECB encryption with said key and encoded in HEX. | "" (empty String)
`UPDATE_ORDER_PAYMENT_STATE`          | if _true_ - `Order#paymentState` will be updated when payment status notification is received from Payone. By default the order's state remains unchanged. | "false" 

**Note**: for integration tests `UPDATE_ORDER_PAYMENT_STATE` is expected to be **`true`**, 
so explicitly setup it in the Heroku environment.

### Build

The Integration is built as a "fat jar" that can be directly started via  the `java -jar` command. The jar is built as follows:

```
./gradlew stage
```

Run the JAR:

```
java -jar service/build/libs/commercetools-payone-integration.jar
```

### Run

#### Docker run

```
docker run \
-e CT_CLIENT_ID=xxx \
-e CT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx \
-e CT_PROJECT_KEY=xxx \
-e PAYONE_KEY=xxx \
-e PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID=xxx \
-e PAYONE_MODE=test|live \
-e PAYONE_PORTAL_ID=xxx \
-e PAYONE_SUBACC_ID=xxx \
sphereio/commercetools-payone-integration 
```

The integration service itself does not provide SSL connectivity, this must be done by a load balancer / SSL terminator running in front of it (which is recommended in any case).
 
#### Local run for development and tests

  In the [`/build.gradle`](/build.gradle) script the [_application_](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html)
  plugin is applied 
  thus `gradle run` task could be used for local run and debug 
  (for example, in Intellij IDEA you could _Run/Debug_ the gradle task `run` from the tasks list).
  
  In the script this `run` task is configured to convert the required runtime values from the local gradle settings 
(`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) to java runtime properties (`-Dkey=value` arguments). 
This allows to skip manually set-up environment variables for the service run.

  To run the built jar from command line in debug mode use (port `1044` is variable): 

  * Listen mode:
      ```
      java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=n,suspend=y,address=1044 -jar service/build/libs/commercetools-payone-integration.jar
      ```

  * Attach mode:
      ```
      java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044 -jar service/build/libs/commercetools-payone-integration.jar
      ```

## Test environments

Via the Payone PMI you have access to a full set of test data, which are implemented in the integration tests of this integration. 

As a notable exception, testing PayPal payments requires developer sandbox accounts at PayPal (see [Paypal Sandbox Accounts](#paypal-sandbox-accounts)).

:warning: Due to PayPal's complex and restrictive browser session handling and the parallel execution of tests (necessary due to PAYONE's notifications which take up to 7 minutes per transaction)
a seperate account is required for each of the transaction types (see [Functional Tests configuration](#functional-tests)).

### Development workflow

> TODO document best practice on how to work in day-to-day development, esp. on how local machine, travis and heroku play together.  

The integration tests of this implementation use a heroku instance of the service. If you are authorized to configure 
it the backend can be found at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/ct-payone-integration-staging/resources .

Please do not access this instance for playground or experimental reasons as you may risk breaking running automated 
integration tests. 

### Functional Tests

You could find the values for Heroku test service and Travis functional tests in the encrypted [`travis-build/`](/travis-build) directory.

**Note**: it's important to update  [`travis-build/`](/travis-build) settings every time you change the build settings 
in Travis config. Even better update first the file, then on the Travis web page.

#### Heroku setup

The test service run it Heroku expected to have the next values:

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Content</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>CT_CLIENT_ID</code></td>                <td rowspan="3">Should be adjusted with Travis setup below</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>CT_CLIENT_SECRET</code></td>            </tr>
  <tr><td><code>CT_PROJECT_KEY</code></td>              </tr>
  <tr><td><code>CT_START_FROM_SCRATCH</code></td>       <td>false</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>PAYONE_KEY</code></td>                  <td rowspan="4">Should be adjusted with Travis setup below</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID</code></td>          </tr>
  <tr><td><code>PAYONE_PORTAL_ID</code></td>            </tr>
  <tr><td><code>PAYONE_SUBACC_ID</code></td>            </tr>
  <tr><td><code>PAYONE_MODE</code></td>                 <td>test</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>UPDATE_ORDER_PAYMENT_STATE</code></td>  <td>true</td></tr>
</table> 

Scheduler values are optional: this feature is not covered by the tests.

#### Known Heroku issues

  Some times Heroku environment has problems, so the functional tests might be unstable. To check Heroku issues use:

  - Heroku CLI commands:
    - `heroku apps:errors`
    - `heroku status`
    - `heroku logs --tail`

  - Heroku web-page https://status.heroku.com/

  As an example of the potential issues see ["Increased rate of "H10 App Crashed" errors"](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/1091)
  incident report, which caused  inconsistent _Socket Timeout_, _503 Service unavailable_ and other connection errors.

#### Travis setup

The executable specification (using [Concordion](http://concordion.org/)) requires the following environment variables
in addition to the [commercetools API client credentials](#commercetools-api-client-credentials):

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Content</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>CT_PAYONE_INTEGRATION_URL</code></td>           <td>the URL of the service instance under test</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_NO_3DS</code></td>   <td>test simple VISA credit card number (don't use real credit card)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_3DS</code></td>      <td>test 3-D secured VISA credit card number (dont' use real credit card)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_3_DS_PASSWORD</code></td>             <td>the 3DS password of the test card. Payone Test Cards use <code>12345</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_SW_BANK_TRANSFER_IBAN</code></td>     <td>the IBAN of a test bank account supporting Sofortueberweisung</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_SW_BANK_TRANSFER_BIC</code></td>      <td>the BIC of a test bank account supporting Sofortueberweisung</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID</code></td>        <td rowspan="4">Payone credentials for pseudocartpan generating. <br/>
                                                                                <b>Ensure these values are the same for Travis (local) test and Heroku deployed service!</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_PAYONE_SUBACC_ID</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_PAYONE_PORTAL_ID</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>TEST_DATA_PAYONE_KEY</code></td></tr>
</table> 

The pseudocardpan for VISA is fetched at runtime for specified `TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_NO_3DS`/`TEST_DATA_VISA_CREDIT_CARD_3DS`
card numbers using PAYONE server API. To do this with the client API please refer to the corresponding Payone API documentation.
With the server API you simply need to send a POST request of type "3dscheck" for example by using a command line tool:

```
curl --data "request=3dscheck&mid=<PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID>&aid=<PAYONE_SUBACC_ID>&portalid=<PAYONE_PORTAL_ID>&key=<MD5_PAYONE_KEY>&mode=test&api_version=3.9&amount=2&currency=EUR&clearingtype=cc&exiturl=http://www.example.com&storecarddata=yes&cardexpiredate=2512&cardcvc2=123&cardtype=V&cardpan=<VISA_CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER>" https://api.pay1.de/post-gateway/
```

* <url> needs to be replaced by the PAYONE api url. You will find this in the server documentation.
* You need to replace the values for mid, aid and portalid with the ones you want to use with PAYONE.
* The value for `MD5_PAYONE_KEY` needs to be the MD5 encryption result of your PAYONE key (`PAYONE_KEY`). 
Use `md5 -qs $PAYONE_KEY` to hash string value to MD5.
* The `cardpan` must be the value of card number. You may get test data values from [wiki page]( https://wiki.commercetools.de/display/DEV/payone#payone-Creditcard%28canbetestedwithpublicIPonly%29).
* Note that the `cardtype` request argument needs to be correspondand: `V` or `M` for _VISA_ and _Master Card_ respectively.

If you have all the values above set in [environment variables](#appendix-2-alternative-configuration-via-properties-file), 
and _md5_ command is available (which is default case on Mac OS X and most of the Linux distributions), 
you may copy-paste and directly execute the next line (change only `<VISA_CREDIT_CARD_3DS_NUMBER>`):

```
curl --data "request=3dscheck&mid=$PAYONE_MERCHANT_ID&aid=$PAYONE_SUBACC_ID&portalid=$PAYONE_PORTAL_ID&key=$(md5 -qs $PAYONE_KEY)&mode=test&api_version=3.9&amount=2&currency=EUR&clearingtype=cc&exiturl=http://www.example.com&storecarddata=yes&cardexpiredate=2512&cardcvc2=123&cardtype=V&cardpan=<VISA_CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER>" https://api.pay1.de/post-gateway/
```

> NOTE:  When sending "storecarddata=yes" at the end you will receive the pseudocardpan in the response from PAYONE.

To run the executable specification invoke the following command line:

```
./gradlew :functionaltests:cleanTest :functionaltests:testSpec
```

The tests take a fairly long time to run as they have to wait for the Payone notification calls to arrive.

Omit `:functionaltests:cleanTest` to run the tests only if something (f.i. the specification) has changed.

#### Publishing functional tests results

The build results are published to [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/tree/gh-pages) branch of the repo.
Then you are able to review the tests results in [Test results page](http://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-payone-integration/).

**Note:** 
  - github pages are overridden by any build of any branch, so in 
  
  - for Travis build `githubPages.repoUri` must be in HTTPS format and `$GH_TOKEN` must be set to GitHub token 
    with push permission
  
  - we should replace the plugin with newer version, see [this issue](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-payone-integration/issues/135)
    for more details 

#### Known functional tests issues

  - Some tests are waiting for payment update notification for payments which are already failed. 
    These cases should be reported and avoided (fail-fast approach).
  
  - Web-driver (selenium) tests which are navigating to web-pages (SofortÃ¼berweisung, 3ds secure verification) may fail 
    because of wrong HTML elements names, if the service providers change html structure of their sites.

### Paypal Sandbox Accounts

To test with Paypal, you need own Sandbox Buyer credentials via a developer account. Available from commercetools, too; please contact support. 

## Contribute Improvements

If you want to add a useful functionality or found a bug please open an issue here to announce and discuss what you
have in mind.  Then fork the project somewhere or in GitHub and create a pull request here once you're done. 

## Development Notes

Please bear in mind that this repository should be free of any IDE specific files, configurations or code. Also, the use
 of frameworks and libraries should be transparent and reasonable.

## Create a custom version

Just fork it. The MIT License allows you to do anything with the code, commercially or noncommercial. 
Contributing an Improvement is the better Idea though because you will save maintanance work when not forking.
